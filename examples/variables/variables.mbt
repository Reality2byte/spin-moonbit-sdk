/// This function is invoked with an incoming HTTP Request, and a resource
/// `response-outparam` which provides the capability to reply with an HTTP
/// Response. The response is sent by calling the `response-outparam.set`
/// method, which allows execution to continue after the response has been
/// sent. This enables both streaming to the response body, and performing other
/// work.
///
/// The implementor of this function must write a response to the
/// `response-outparam` before returning, or else the caller will respond
/// with an error on its behalf.
